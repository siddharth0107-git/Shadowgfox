# 🚗 BMW Worldwide Sales Analysis (2010–2024)

This project explores global BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024 using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The goal is to understand how BMW’s sales have evolved over the years, identify top-performing models and regions, and uncover meaningful patterns through data visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this task, I selected a real-world dataset containing BMW vehicle information such as:
- Model
- Year
- Region
- Engine size
- Price
- Sales volume

Using this data, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created visualizations to answer a key research question:

### **🔍 Research Question**
**How did BMW’s global sales and revenue change between 2010 and 2024, and which models and regions contributed the most to this growth?**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data handling and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  

These tools helped process the dataset, find patterns, and create clear and meaningful charts.

## 📊 What This Project Includes

### **1. Data Loading & Cleaning**
- Loaded the BMW dataset from CSV  
- Removed unnecessary columns  
- Created a new **Revenue** column using:  
  `Revenue = Price × Sales Volume`  
- Prepared data for time-series and model-based analysis  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
I explored:
- Total units sold each year  
- How revenue changed over time  
- Top BMW models based on sales  
- Best-performing regions  
- Engine size impact on pricing  

### **3. Visualizations**
The notebook includes clear and easy-to-understand charts such as:
- Yearly sales volume trend  
- Yearly revenue trend  
- Top 10 BMW models by revenue  
- Top 10 regions by revenue  
- Revenue market share (pie chart)  
- Engine size vs. average price  

These visuals helped identify which models and regions drive BMW’s market performance.

## 💡 Key Insights (Human Summary)
- Sales and revenue show clear year-to-year trends, highlighting growth periods and slowdowns.  
- A few BMW models contribute a large portion of total revenue.  
- Certain regions consistently generate higher sales than others.  
- Engine size often correlates with higher pricing, as expected in luxury automotive markets.  

These insights can help understand BMW’s market behavior and strategic areas of improvement.
