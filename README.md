# 🟡 Intermediate Task — Delhi Air Quality (AQI) Analysis

### **Objective:**  
Analyze Delhi’s pollution levels using real pollutant data and create a custom estimated AQI.

### **Key Steps:**
- Cleaned the dataset and formatted date values  
- Created an AQI metric using pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3  
- Added Month and Weekday columns for deeper insights  
- Visualized trends using line charts, bar charts, boxplots, and heatmaps  

### **Key Insights:**
- Delhi’s average estimated AQI ≈ **180 (Poor category)**  
- Pollution peaks during **November–January**  
- **PM2.5 and PM10** are the major contributors  
- Air quality improves during the monsoon season  

This task strengthened my skills in feature creation and analytical storytelling.

# 🔵 Advanced Task — BMW Worldwide Sales Analysis (2010–2024)

### **Objective:**  
Explore BMW’s global sales, revenue changes, and model/region performance from 2010 to 2024.

### **What I Did:**
- Loaded and cleaned multi-year automotive data  
- Created a revenue column: **Revenue = Price × Sales Volume**  
- Identified top-performing models and regions  
- Analyzed sales and revenue trends  
- Created visuals like line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts  

### **Key Insights:**
- BMW’s revenue follows clear year-by-year trends  
- Few top models account for a large share of revenue  
- Certain regions consistently outperform others  
- Larger engine sizes generally correlate with higher pricing  

This task helped me understand business analytics and multi-dimensional analysis.
